# Faster-RCNN Object Detection Model Implemented from Scratch

This repo was formed to learn how the Faster-RCNN backend architecture (backbone, anchors, RPN, RCNN) works.


## Setup
```
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```
## Roadmap
- [x] Faster-RCNN model  
- [x] Unit tests for model  
- [x] repo is pip installable
- [ ] Load exisiting model weights  
- [ ] Training scripts  
- [ ] Eval scripts  
- [ ] Example notebooks
